Rock-Paper-Scissors Game with The Odin Project

This project involves building a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using JavaScript. The game is designed to be played via the console, meaning it has no graphical user interface (GUI). The project is a part of The Odin Project curriculum, which aims to help developers learn web development through hands-on projects.

Key Features:

-   Console-based gameplay
-   Randomized computer moves
-   Player vs. Computer matches
-   Simple game logic to determine the winner

The primary goal of this project is to practice JavaScript fundamentals, including functions, loops, and conditionals. It serves as an introduction to interactive programming and basic game development.
